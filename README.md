# Automated_Validation
A tool for automated validation of LDE (logic_based ODE) signaling network models without requiring reaction kinetics' knowledge. This tool generates an LDE model from an interaction graph data and simulates experimental conditions and outputs the model's validation data as an Excel file. This tool uses Netflux software for generating the model.
